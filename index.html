  <h1 id="header">Hello!</h1>

    <p>I’m a student at the Missouri School of Journalism studying magazine journalism and
      emphasizing in arts & culture. I work as an assistant editor in Vox Magazine’s
      culture department by pitching community stories and collaborating with writers to
      bring insightful journalism for our local audience. My passion for writing and editing
    keeps me determined, sincere and always eager to learn more.

    <br>
    While off the clock, I enjoy listening to music, following my favorite sports teams,
    practicing Spanish and playing with my dog Benny. You can reach me at
    etmusil08@sbcglobal.net.</p>
